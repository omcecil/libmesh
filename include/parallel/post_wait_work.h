 * An abstract base class that can be subclassed to allow other code

 * to automatically schedule deserialization, cleanup, or other
 * operations such that they automatically take place after an
 * asynchronous I/O operation has completed.
 *
 * See PostWaitCopyBuffer, PostWaitDeleteBuffer, and
 * PostWaitUnpackBuffer for examples of useful subclasses that are
 * automatically employed by the library.  See the
 * Request::add_post_wait_work method for documentation of how to use
 * these subclasses.  See Communicator method implementations for
 * examples of all this in use, including chaining of multiple
 * PostWaitWork operations.
